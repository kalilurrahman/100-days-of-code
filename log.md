**Today's Progress**: Worked on first version of auto generating Quotes Presentations from Google Sheets. This was a breather

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with initisl setup, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Restart of coding is unique for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
